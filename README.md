#Conditional Assignment

This repo contains an html and Javascript file.The `index.html` file is a basic webpage that displays some text and allows the user to inspect the console. Within `client.js` there is `function compareNumbers(numOne, numTwo)` which passes in two numbers as parameters. Upon entering the function both parameters are set to either `parseFloat(numOne)` or `parseFloat(numTwo)` in order to isolate a starting number from a string in case a string is entered. Then I set `var message` as an empty string to concatenate the string of whichever conditional is true from the `if`, `else if`, or `else` blocks. At the end of the function, the reassigned `message` is returned.
